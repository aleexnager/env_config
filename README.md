# UNIX Enviroment Configuration
UNIX terminal enviroment configuration  
  
Wellcome, in this repository you can find my basic configuration I use when working in my personal UNIX enviroments.  

>[!TIP]
>Before adding this new functionalities, you can change them in the **conf_files** directory.

## Usage
Super easy configuration process, just download this repository on your local machine and follow one of the two following methods.

### 1. Using setup.sh [RECOMENDED]
This is the fastest and easiest method. Once downloaded, locate the setup.sh configuration file and execute it with `./setup.sh`. Make sure it has the propper permissions. Remember you can give permissions with the 'chmod +` command.  
Once executed, you are done and some messages will inform you of the process and changes made. 

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Make sure setup.sh has the execute command. In case it doesn`t, use `chmod +x setup.sh` to grant the execute permission.

### 2. Copying .cfg files
This is a rudimentary method. Just go in de **conf_files** directory and copy the content inside de .cfg files to your .bash_aliases and .bashrc files.

>[!NOTE]
>.bash_aliases may not exist so you will have to create it or add the alias commands inside the .bashrc file.
